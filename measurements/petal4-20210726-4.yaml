# Petal Position (Per DESI-3596)

# Which BMR (Ball Mount Refectors) mount plate configuration is used.
# 3 choices :
#  "guide_spikes" BMR plate mounted on the petal guide spikes for petal insertion procedure
#  "light_weight_red_leg" # BMR plate mounted at the tip of the red
#  "heavy_weight_red_leg" # BMR plate mounted at the tip of the red with a weight matching that of a petal

bmr_type: "light_weight_red_leg"
